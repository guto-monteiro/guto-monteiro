In October 2023, the members of Lab Tsai participated in the 32nd Brazilian Congress of Microbiology in Foz-do-Iguaçu at the Raffain Hotel. I've had the chance to present two abstracts and two posters during the environmental microbiology session. The [first abstract](/assets/pdf/Abstract_CBM1.pdf) detailed an anaerobic incubation experiment with soil from the Amazonas River, which can be viewed in the presentation in the [first poster](/assets/pdf/Poster_CBM-1.pdf). The [second abstract](/assets/pdf/Abstract_CBM2.pdf) detailed the microbial ecology of methanotrophs and methanogens across three floodplains in the lower Amazon basin and the possible links between the carbon and nitrogen cycle during the rainy season, which can be viewed in the [second poster](/assets/pdf/Poster_CBM-2.pdf).

I was honored to win the [best poster award](/assets/pdf/Best_poster_award.pdf) in the soil microbiology session. I thank Prof. Acácio Navarrete and his students for their outstanding work during the project and for his fantastic supervision and teachings.
