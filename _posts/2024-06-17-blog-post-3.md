In June, members of Tsai's lab, myself included, visited the Netherlands Institute of Ecology as guests of [Prof. Wim van der Putten](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/wim-van-der-putten-1.htm). The visit was part of the project "Applying the biotic soil legacy approach to understand positive-negative biota interactions for direct forest restoration from plant-soil communities feedbacks", which is a joint initiative between the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and The SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). Both Brazilian and Dutch students shared their latest results during the day.

Many thanks to prof. Wim for the great opportunity and incredible talks about soil microbiology
