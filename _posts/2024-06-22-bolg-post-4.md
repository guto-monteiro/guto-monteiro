From June 17 to 21, the 5th Plant Microbiome Symposium (PMS) occurred at the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) in Amsterdam (Netherlands). Together with other students from the Tsai's Lab,
I had the opportunity to present a poster peering at the first results from my M.Sc thesis and the role of litter fungi in the carbon dynamics of agroforests in the Amazon Rainforest.
