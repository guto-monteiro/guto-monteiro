From August 18-23, the ISME society organized one of the biggest symposiums in Microbiology, the 19th International Symposium on Microbial Ecology (ISME) at Cape Town (South Africa). Together with other students from the Tsai's Lab, I had the opportunity to submit an [abstract](/assets/pdf/Abstract_ISME.pdf) and present a [poster](/assets/pdf/Poster_ISME.pdf) describing the role of water biogeochemistry in the microbial community assembly of three major Amazon Rivers.
