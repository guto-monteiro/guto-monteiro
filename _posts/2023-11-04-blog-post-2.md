For anyone interested in short courses on bioinformatics, the [8th Emerging Bioinformatics Approaches for Microbial Ecogenomics](file:///Users/maignien/ebame/ebame8/index.html) was an excellent opportunity for early career researchers to get in touch with bioinformaticians from around the world! I attended the course organized in the end of October 2023 in Brest (France).
