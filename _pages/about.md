My name is Gabriel Monteiro, and I am a master's student funded by the [São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)](https://fapesp.br/en) at the [Center for Nuclear Energy in Agriculture](http://www.cena.usp.br/) of the University of São Paulo (Brazil). I'm working in Prof. Siu Mui Tsai's group on the soil microbial carbon metabolism across tropical agroforests, with a particular emphasis on the dissolved organic matter molecular composition and its relation to microbial community function

I am a soil microbial and chemical ecologist fascinated by plant-soil-microbes interactions. My goal as a (microbial) researcher is to explore the complex interactions between the aboveground plants and the belowground soil and microbes in tropical ecosystems in the context of climate change. To accomplish this, we rely on different techniques such as molecular biology, next-generation sequencing, and mass spectrometry.
